# Breakout Demo

this one kinda works, but the collision detection is really strange.

anyway, I guess I'll leave this on as it is now. because the concept and structure is there.

But it feels a bit over engineered, it would probably feel much more like that if the compiler would let me store function pointers inside structs. 

I hope this Demo will help out someone someday, probably not...
